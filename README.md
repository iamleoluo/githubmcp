# GitHubMCP Demo: Automated Repository Publishing

This project demonstrates how to use `github.mcp` to automatically publish a local project to your GitHub account. The process is fully automated and does not require manual git commands for pushing filesâ€”everything is handled via the GitHub MCP integration.

## What This Demo Shows
- How to create a new repository on GitHub using automation
- How to push files (like this README) to your GitHub repository automatically
- How to synchronize your local project with your remote GitHub repository

## Steps Demonstrated
1. **Create a GitHub Repository Automatically**
   - The repository (`githubmcp`) was created on GitHub using the MCP integration, with no manual steps on the GitHub website.
2. **Push Files via MCP**
   - Project files (such as this README) were pushed directly to the new repository using the GitHub MCP API, not with local git commands.
3. **Synchronize Local and Remote**
   - To sync your local project with the remote repository, you can add the remote and fetch the latest changes:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin https://github.com/iamleoluo/githubmcp.git
     git fetch origin
     git checkout -b main origin/main
     ```

## Why Use This Approach?
- **No manual git commands needed for initial publishing**
- **Great for automation, bots, or CI/CD pipelines**
- **Ensures your project is quickly available on GitHub**

## Next Steps
- Add more files to your project and use MCP to push them
- Use the repository as a template for automated publishing workflows
